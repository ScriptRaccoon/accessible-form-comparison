# Accessible Forms

This repository includes two forms which are very similar, but one is inaccessible and the other one is accessible.

The accessible form has the following features:
- semantic HTML tags
- labels for inputs
- inputs of type email and password
- no placeholders
- outlines for interactive elements
- high contrast for text
- aria-describedby for descriptions
- aria-live for error messages
- aria-hidden for decorative images
- alt text for image

All this makes the form suitable for keyboard navigation and screenreaders.
 
Intended to be a used for a tutorial on web accessibility.
