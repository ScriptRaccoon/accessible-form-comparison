# Accessible Forms

This repository includes two forms which are very similar, but one is accessible while the other one is not.

-   https://accessible-form.netlify.app
-   https://inaccessible-form.netlify.app

The accessible form has the following features:

-   semantic HTML tags
-   labels for inputs
-   inputs of type email and password
-   no placeholders
-   outlines for interactive elements
-   high contrast for text
-   aria-describedby for descriptions
-   aria-live for error messages
-   aria-hidden for decorative images
-   alt text for important images
-   indicators for required fields

All this makes the form suitable for keyboard navigation and screenreaders.

This repository will be used for a tutorial on web accessibility.
